# About me 

Hello! My name's Cooper and I'm currently a student at UVA studying Statistics and Data Science. I'm involved in a few research labs and I hopefully want to work in data science/analytics once I graduate. Outside of class I really enjoy biking, cooking, and jazz (I play saxophone!). Enjoy this emoji of a fish: 🐟
